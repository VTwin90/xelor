# **Milestone 4: XELOR**

### **Project - Full-Stack Frameworks with Django - Code Institute.**
This is the fourth milestone project from CI with a focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django, relational database(Postgres), stripe payments, and AWS. The point is to build a full-stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. Also, to set up an authentication mechanism. XELOR is an e-commerce store for unisex luxury watches with brands like Omega, Rolex, Armani, and Gucci. 

A deployed link to the website can be found **[here](https://xelor-watches.herokuapp.com/)**.

### **What is needed now and in the future?**

* The developer wants an aesthetically pleasing and minimalistic website. This is to better showcase the main point: the watches. There will be a landing page to grab attention and options to log in or register to the site. The user has the option to browse the shop and buy products without being registered. But also get additional functions/services if the user has registered and logged in,

* The owner could have their needs and more by using a mobile-first approach to a fully responsive website which would allow for easy navigation, use, and no diminished experiences on all viewport sizes.

* Other features further down the line will give the website an even better user experience by incorporating: a rating/like-system to showcase the most popular watches from customers. Also, to include a comment section(with avatar images): where users can give feedback on individual watches but also on the blog posts. Including more product images to improve users' view and perspective of the products.

### **Design Choices from UXD**

The style is based on a minimalistic, readable, and contrasting design for easy flow and navigation, as well as maintaining consistency to allow the user to easily familiarise themselves with the website efficiently and intuitively.
